        <b>Recyclable</b>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Recyclable materials</strong> are those that can be reprocessed and turned into new products,
          reducing the need for fresh resources and cutting down on waste. Items like paper, cardboard, glass, some
          plastics, and metals fall into this category. When recycled correctly, these materials are cleaned, sorted,
          and transformed into new products, helping to conserve resources and lessen the burden on landfills.</p>

        <p><strong>Recyclable items</strong> can be converted into new products through specialized processes, which
          minimizes the need for new raw materials and decreases waste. Common examples include paper, cardboard,
          certain plastics, metals, and glass. By recycling these materials, you contribute to resource conservation and
          waste reduction, as they are repurposed rather than disposed of in landfills.</p>

        <p><strong>Materials that can be recycled</strong> are those that can undergo a transformation process to be
          repurposed into new goods. Examples include paper, cardboard, glass, various plastics, and metals. This
          process helps conserve natural resources and reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, supporting
          a more sustainable waste management system.</p>

        <b>Non-Recyclable</b>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Non-recyclable materials</strong> are items that cannot be processed through standard recycling
          systems and typically end up in landfills or incinerators. These include plastic bags, certain food packaging,
          and other contaminants. Proper disposal of these items is important to avoid contaminating recyclable
          materials and to manage waste effectively.</p>

        <p><strong>Materials that are non-recyclable</strong> cannot be processed into new products through traditional
          recycling methods and usually need to be discarded as waste. Examples include certain types of plastics,
          contaminated food containers, and plastic bags. Correctly managing these items helps prevent contamination of
          recyclable waste and ensures responsible waste handling.</p>

        <p><strong>Items classified as non-recyclable</strong> cannot be reprocessed through conventional recycling
          systems and often end up in landfills or are incinerated. These include things like specific plastic types,
          dirty food packaging, and plastic bags. Effective disposal of these materials is essential to maintaining the
          integrity of recyclable waste and managing environmental impact.</p>
